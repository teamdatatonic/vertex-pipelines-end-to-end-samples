    "# MLOps Hackathon\n",
    "\n",
    "This hackathon is based on the [open-source Turbo Template](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/vertex-pipelines-end-to-end-samples).\n",
    "Through this notebook series you'll get hands-on with the template and Google Cloud.\n",
    "The hackathon is structured into the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Health check](./01_health_check.ipynb)\n",
    "1. **[Run pipelines](./02_run_pipelines.ipynb) - this notebook**\n",
    "1. [Promote model](./03_promote_model.ipynb)\n",
    "1. [Challenge: Model monitoring](./04_monitoring_challenge.ipynb)\n",
    "1. [Challenge: Real-time predictions](./05_realtime_challenge.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you'll run your first training and prediction pipelines. \n",
    "You'll learn about containers, pipelines, caching, and `make` as a productivity accelerator."
